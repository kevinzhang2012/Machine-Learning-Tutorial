    "We saw how we could use linear regression to build a model that encodes a pattern in data. This model (equation), could then be used to either describe the relationship that exists in the data, or it could also be used as a way of predicting the response variable based on input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will consider a machine learning (ML) algorithm that is arguably one of the most intuitive\n",
    "of all the machine learning algorithms. It is a **simple algorithm** but despite its simplicity, it is a **widely used algorithm in business and industrial settings**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm we will use is called **k-nearest neighbors (kNN)**. kNN is a curious ML algorithm as it **does not require us to explicitly build a model**. The data itself is the model. kNN is referred to as an instance-based learning algorithm, or a lazy learning algorithm as it does no computation until a classification is required. It is useful as it can be used in both regression (continuous value prediction) or classification (class label prediction) problems.\n",

    "So how does it work? As it turns out, it works very much like we do when faced with solving a problem. If you were asked to find out what the price for a 2 bedroom, 1 garage rental home in Albany would cost, how would you do it? You would most likely go to TradeMe as we did before or some other Real Estate agency website and look up a number of homes that are most similar to the requirement of \"2 bedroom, 1 garage\" home in Albany. Once you have these figures, you would then average and aggregate their prices to come up with your estimate. kNN works the same, where `k` represents the total number of instances closest to the data point you are wanting to classify.\n",

    "**Resemblence quantifies the extent to which two things are similar or different to one another.**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many resemblence metrics we can use, in this example we will consider the Euclidean distance. The resemblence metric in kNN forms the other part of the model. We calculate $d$ as the distance between points $x$ and $y$, having 2 features as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$ d(x, y) = \\sqrt{ (x_i-y_i)^2 + (x_j-y_j)^2}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above distance measure works well for a house query where we want to know how close house $x$ is to house $y$ given that both $x$ and $y$ have 2 features, $i$ and $j$ to represent a feature for `bedroom` and a feature for `garage`. But what if you wanted to find out how similar 2 houses were based on more than two features such as houses with \"2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 1 garage, 2 living areas, 150m$^2$\"? Euclidean distance can easily be generalized to multiple features as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$d(x, y) = \\sqrt{(x_1- y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2+...+(x_i - y_i)^2+...+(x_n - y_n)^2}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find the `k` most similar data points to $x$, we therefore must calculate the **similarity** ($d$ values) of $x$ to all the $y$s in the dataset. Then we must **order** the list of $d$ values from smallest to greatest, and **select the `k` first values** in the list. All that remains to be done then is to take the house price of the `k` values and find the mean. The mean value then represents our prediction for the house price given the requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tricky part is selecting the **size of `k`**. If the dataset were perfect, then `k=1` would be enough to return the correct answer. However, this is almost never the case and so we need to aggregate data from several neghbours in order to account for `noise` that might exist in the data. **Having a `k` that is too small will likely produce a result that captures the idosyncracies within the data, while having a `k` that is too high will aggregate too many data points and produce inaccurate results as well.**"

    "\n",
    "One of the drawbacks of kNN is the computational overhead in calculating distances during the classification/runtime. Research into more efficient methods is still an ongoing area of study. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most naive search algorithms  involves the brute-force computation of distances between all pairs of points in the dataset. Given N samples in D dimensions, this approach has the computational complexity of:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"font-size: 150%;\">  \n",
    "$$ \\text{Brute force} = O(D N^2) $$\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient brute-force algorithms can be very competitive for small data samples. However, as the number of samples N grows, the brute-force approach quickly becomes infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the computational inefficiencies of the brute-force approach, a variety of tree-based data structures have been invented. In general, these structures attempt to reduce the required number of distance calculations by efficiently encoding aggregate distance information for the sample. The basic idea is that if point A is very distant from point B, and point B is very close to point C, then we know that points A and C are very distant, without having to explicitly calculate their distance. An early approach to taking advantage of this aggregate information was the KD tree data structure. Though the KD tree approach is very fast for low-dimensional (D < 20) neighbors searches, it becomes inefficient as D grows very large: this is one manifestation of the so-called “curse of dimensionality”.\n",
    "\n",
    "KD tree query time changes with D in a way that is difficult to precisely characterise. For small D (less than 20 or so) the cost is approximately O[D log(N)], and the KD tree query can be very efficient. For larger D, the cost increases to nearly that of the brute force approach.\n",

    "To address the inefficiencies of KD Trees in higher dimensions, the ball tree data structure was developed. Where KD trees partition data along Cartesian axes, ball trees partition data in a series of nesting hyper-spheres. This makes tree construction more costly than that of the KD tree, but results in a data structure which can be very efficient on highly-structured data, even in very high dimensions.  The ball tree can out-perform a KD-tree in high dimensions, though the actual performance is highly dependent on the structure of the training data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Nearest neighbours algorithm has been successful in a broad range of classification and regression problems. These include handwritten digits and satellite image scenes. Due to the fact that it is a non-parametric method, it is often effective in classification situations where the decision boundary is very irregular. \n",

    "The few disadvantages of the nearest neighbours algorithm include it's computational intensity when making predictions because the distance to every point has to be calculated; however, there are ways that this can to a degree be mitigated. Nearest neighbours algorithm is also sensitive to noisy and irrelevant features. "
